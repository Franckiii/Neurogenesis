# Neurogenesis

This notebook explores the development of a dynamic growing artificial neural network (ANN) through pruning and neurogenesis techniques. Thanks to the iterative processes of adding and removing neurons, the network dynamically adapts its architecture during training to optimize both performance and efficiency. The notebook investigates how the pruning, which involves removing redundant or less relevant neurons to streamline the network, works to understand a more complex type of dynamix : neurogenesis, which involves adding new neurons to enhance network capacity, . Various strategies for triggering neurogenesis and determining which neurons to prune are examined, with a focus on achieving a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency. Experimental results and demonstrations illustrate how this dynamic approach can lead to compact yet performant networks across different tasks and datasets. Overall, the notebook provides insights into the potential of dynamic growing ANNs and offers practical guidance for implementing and experimenting with these techniques.
